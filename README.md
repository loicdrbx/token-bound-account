The token bound accounts standard (ERC-6551) defines a system that assigns Ethereum accounts to NFTs. These accounts, which are now "token bound", enable NFTs to own assets and interact with applications. This project is a simple implementation of ERC 6551 and is intended for learning and exploration purposes.

It is built by extending the OpenZeppelin ERC-721 contract and uses boilerplate code from an NFT workshop given at Hack the North. The contracts are built on the REMIX IDE and deployed/tested on the Goerli testnet.
